# NB36 Solution Demo
## Introduction
This repo contains a FastAPI backend that handles the E2E process of vetting credit card applications made by prospective NB36 users and provides a clear approve, reject or escalate decision for a given application.

The vetting process involves consuming three third-party APIs for fetching KYC, credit history and income verification data. The outputs of these calls are then subject to knockout rules determined by NB36 risk personnel.

## Solution architecture

## Mock-up of flow
Take the following JSON generated by the NB36 backend that might be sent to the /evaluateCreditApp endpoint:
```json
{
  "application_id": "123456789",
  "personal_details": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "date_of_birth": "1990-05-15",
    "ssn": "123-45-6789",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890"
  },
  "address": {
    "street_address": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip_code": "10001",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "employment_details": {
    "employer_name": "TechCorp Inc.",
    "job_title": "Software Engineer",
    "annual_income": 85000,
    "employment_status": "Full-time",
    "work_phone": "+1234567891"
  },
  "financial_details": {
    "existing_debt": 10000,
    "monthly_expenses": 2000,
    "credit_score": 720,
    "bank_account": {
      "account_type": "Checking",
      "bank_name": "BigBank",
      "account_number": "1234567890",
      "routing_number": "111000025"
    }
  },
  "additional_info": {
    "desired_credit_limit": 5000,
    "purpose_of_credit": "Personal expenses",
    "referred_by": "Friend"
  },
  "consent": {
    "terms_accepted": true,
    "credit_check_consent": true,
    "data_sharing_consent": true
  }
}
```
I want to demonstrate how one of the three lambda functions would process its third-party API content through knockout rules. Specifically, I want to show how a mocked response from the Experian API is taken through knockout rules and parameters input into the Taktile frontend by NB36 risk personnel.
